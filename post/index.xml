      <description>I use Arch Linux on my poor seven year old laptop. My experience has been overwhelmingly positive&amp;hellip; buuuuuuuuuuut, there have been a few times that my computers performance has driven me to the edge. Most of those experiences have been in attempting to install packages from the Arch User Repository or the AUR for short.
Let&amp;rsquo;s step back. Quick intro to Arch and a link to the projects home on the web: Arch is a &amp;lsquo;lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.</description>

      <description>WordPress. A PHP based CMS with a MySQL database that generates pages as they are requested. Reviled. Loved. Free. Open Source. The most used content management system on the WWW. Make or choose any obnoxious plugin you want. Complain about that free plugin not being maintained well.
Whatever. Setting up a local development environment for WordPress (WP) has always been harder than it should have been for me but I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering that here.</description>

      <description>Initiate planning sequence for cleaning up my privacy mess.
Step one, leaving Facebook. Since the beginning of personalized ads we&amp;rsquo;ve been told that ads configured to our habits are better than just random ones. I thought that made sense for a long time. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I rather see ads relevant to my interests?
Nope.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want marketing companies tracking my interests. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my browsing habits and metadata collected for the creation of curated ads or worse.</description>

      <description>Computers More fun python this month with lil projects in Django and Flask. Currently working on a simple dashboard for displaying the data collected by a solar array, cleaning up my own portfolio, and starting work on a lil web app to output nicely formatted &amp;lsquo;set lists&amp;rsquo; of your Spotify playlists. That should be fun little introduction to the Spotify API and give me an idea of what might be possible.</description>

      <description>Finally had some free time to come back to my prepared Django environment and mess around with a starter project. You can follow the same walkthrough I did. I&amp;rsquo;ll just highlight some of the interesting things learned.

      <description>Django is a web framework that runs on python. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten well acquainted with the python syntax exploring Django has become much more intriguing. In this post I work through the DjangoGirls intro to Django tutorial which was presented in Seattle in April 2017. One of my classmates attended (Margarita) and passed on the tutorial to me. You can find the walkthrough here: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the setup through the point at which Django serves its default project page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring Hugo for a bit and decided that I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy my fresh blog site to the /blog/ subdirectory of my https://jmnofziger.github.io base url. However, my attempts to do that locally resulted in resources not being linked correctly. CSS stylesheets couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found, JS scripts couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found; all my resources were return 404. An inspection with the browser console showed that resource URL&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t being updated to reflect https://jmnofziger.</description>

      <description>After playing with Jekyll I became curious about other options for static site generations. This is my attempt at working with Hugo, a simple site generator that runs on Go.</description>
