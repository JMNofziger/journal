      <description>Django is a web framework that runs on python. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten well acquainted with the python syntax exploring Django has become much more intriguing. In this post I work through the DjangoGirls intro to Django tutorial which was presented in Seattle in April 2017. One of my classmates attended (Margarita) and passed on the tutorial to me. You can find the walkthrough here: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the setup through the point at which Django serves its default project page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring Hugo for a bit and decided that I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy my fresh blog site to the /blog/ subdirectory of my https://jmnofziger.github.io base url. However, my attempts to do that locally resulted in resources not being linked correctly. CSS stylesheets couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found, JS scripts couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found; all my resources were return 404. An inspection with the browser console showed that resource URL&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t being updated to reflect https://jmnofziger.</description>

      <description>After playing with Jekyll I became curious about other options for static site generations. This is my attempt at working with Hugo, a simple site generator that runs on Go.</description>
