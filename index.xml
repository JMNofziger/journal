      <description>Initiate planning sequence for cleaning up my privacy mess.
Step one, leaving Facebook. Since the beginning of personalized ads we&amp;rsquo;ve been told that ads configured to our habits are better than just random ones. I thought that made sense for a long time. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I rather see ads relevant to my interests?
Nope.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want marketing companies tracking my interests. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my browsing habits and metadata collected for the creation of curated ads or worse.</description>

      <description>Computers More fun python this month with lil projects in Django and Flask. Currently working on a simple dashboard for displaying the data collected by a solar array, cleaning up my own portfolio, and starting work on a lil web app to output nicely formatted &amp;lsquo;set lists&amp;rsquo; of your Spotify playlists. That should be fun little introduction to the Spotify API and give me an idea of what might be possible.</description>

      <description>Django is a web framework that runs on python. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten well acquainted with the python syntax exploring Django has become much more intriguing. In this post I work through the DjangoGirls intro to Django tutorial which was presented in Seattle in April 2017. One of my classmates attended (Margarita) and passed on the tutorial to me. You can find the walkthrough here: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the setup through the point at which Django serves its default project page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring Hugo for a bit and decided that I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy my fresh blog site to the /blog/ subdirectory of my https://jmnofziger.github.io base url. However, my attempts to do that locally resulted in resources not being linked correctly. CSS stylesheets couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found, JS scripts couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found; all my resources were return 404. An inspection with the browser console showed that resource URL&amp;rsquo;s weren&amp;rsquo;t being updated to reflect https://jmnofziger.</description>

      <description>After playing with Jekyll I became curious about other options for static site generations. This is my attempt at working with Hugo, a simple site generator that runs on Go.</description>
