      <description>Spotify: a music streaming service with social features. Spotify has become the means by which I can most effectively mooch off my friends great taste in music. Spotify allows you to share your daily listening activity, playlists, and top artists with your &amp;ldquo;followers&amp;rdquo; and the general public. They also have a great API for developers to build with but we&amp;rsquo;ll save those ideas for another post.
Unfortunately, it seems like some users are having a hard time locating their friends on Spotify.</description>

      <description>Computers More fun python this month with lil projects in Django and Flask. Currently working on a simple dashboard for displaying the data collected by a solar array, cleaning up my own portfolio, and starting work on a lil web app to output nicely formatted &amp;lsquo;set lists&amp;rsquo; of your Spotify playlists. That should be fun little introduction to the Spotify API and give me an idea of what might be possible.</description>
